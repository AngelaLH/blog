--------------
[SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf) is a
multi-format PDF, XPS, ebook (ePub, MOBI), DjVu etc. reader for Windows
and [we](http://www.ohloh.net/p/4623/contributors) are pleased to
announce version 2.1.

The biggest change in this version is a support for ePub ebook format.
ePub is one of the 2 most popular ebook standards (the other one,
[mobi](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/articles/mobi-ebook-reader-viewer-for-windows.html),
is already supported by Sumatra). Unfortunately we can only read ebooks
that are not DRM protected.

We’ve added File/Rename menu item to rename currently viewed file
(contributed by Vasily Fomin).

We’ve added support for multi-page TIFF files, TGA images, more comic
book (CBZ) metadata.

We’ve added support for JPEG XR images (available on Windows Vista or
later, for Windows XP the [Windows Imaging
Component](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=32)
has to be installed)

The installer is now signed, for even better installation experience.

Me, a social marketer
---------------------

Four months ago I started an experiment in social marketing of
[SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html),
my free PDF viewer for Windows.

Let me rephrase that without the buzzwords: four months ago I added
Google buzz, tweet and Facebook like buttons to Sumatra’s web pages:

This is a reflection on changing habits of how people share what they
find on the web. Blogs used to be the medium to write about products and
services people found useful. Blogs are still going strong but
tweeting/buzzing/liking is much easier than writing a blog post so it
became a dominant way of sharing cool finds.

It took me about an hour to add the 3 most popular buttons, so there was
no reason not to try it.

A button promotes a given page (as identified by a url). In case of
Sumatra, they promote the main (landing) page.

When I installed the buttons on 9-19-2010, I already had 529 Buzz posts
(a suspiciously large number), 44 tweets and 16 Facebook likes (those
services track number of mentions for a given page even if they
originate from other places which gave me a jump start).

Me, a failed social marketer
----------------------------

As far as I can tell, it was a dismal failure.

The purpose of marketing is to make people more aware of your software.
The theory is that a tweet or a like shows up on people’s twitter or
facebook streams whcih leads them to click on the link and visit your
website.

You can track the effectiveness of such marketing by counting how many
people come to your website from twitter.com or Facebook.com (I do it
with Google Analytics).

The results are terrible. In the last month, I got 82 visits from
facebook.com (out of 350.000 pageviews), which makes it 116th referal
source. Inexplicably twitter.com doesn’t even show up in the list of
first 500 referal sources.

In those four months I got 314 facebook likes (78 per month) and 29
tweets (7 per month).

To give some perspective: before installing those buttons Sumatra
averaged around 4.000 downloads a day and getting more than 300.000 page
views a month.

That means that insignificant number of the people downloading the
software or visiting SumatraPDF website use the tweet or like buttons.

I also know from monitoring twitter for mentions of Sumatra that people
tweet about it on their own.

Incremental traffic from Twitter or Facebook to my website is
negligible.

Why so failure?
---------------

I didn’t expect miracles but I also didn’t expect such a massive
failure.

One possibility is that I horribly botched interpretation of the
results.

Another possibility is that those things don’t work well for software.
Unlike a cute picture or a blog post, software cannot be evaluated by
just looking at the website. You need to use it for a while to decide if
it’s good or not so it doesn’t lend itself to impulsive tweets of
admiration.

On the other hand, I’ve seen web pages for software that I’m pretty sure
is less popular than Sumatra and had way more than my measly 44 tweets.

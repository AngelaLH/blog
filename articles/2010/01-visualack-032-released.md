[ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) is a good improvement on grep. When I
discovered it, I decided to write a similar tool in Cocoa, exclusively
for Mac OS X and with (optional) UI.
[VisualAck](/software/vack/index.html) is a
result of that decision (and a testimony to my unimaginative naming
skills).

It’s a first public public release with a rather arbitrary version
number. The only important part about the version number is that it’s
not 1.0, which means that this program is a work in progress.

So [try it out](/software/vack/index.html) and
let me know how it works for you.

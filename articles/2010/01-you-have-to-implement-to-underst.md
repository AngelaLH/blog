Title: You have to implement to understand

It happens all the time:

-   I try to read an article or a paper on a programming technique, say
    B-Trees
-   I read and understand the first few pages about motivation behind
    the technique and other expositions
-   when it comes to the details, my eyes start to glaze over, I read
    but I rarely understand

I end up being aware of techniques, but not really understanding them at
the same level I understand linked list (which I’ve implemented many
times in my programs). The time I spent reading the paper feels wasted.

For example, I’ve read about skip lists several times in the past but
today is the first time I can say that I understand skip lists well
enough to implement them. Why? Because today I have actually implemented
them.

You have to implement to truly understand.

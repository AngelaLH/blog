[typical](http://chabry.caltech.edu/~t/resume/hyper-res.html)
[resume](http://beta.ece.ucsb.edu/~wesc/res2.html) looks like. My
opinion is that it's impossible to tell anything from a typical resume.

So a guy says he knows PHP. Does it mean that he's a PHP guru who has
written 100k lines of PHP code or that he's just finished "Learn PHP in
15 minutes"? No way to tell.

My idea: blog your resume.

In addition to a standard resume keep a log of all the stuff you're
learning and doing. E.g. if today you wrote a 5k lines perl script that
spiders the web and extracts interesting info, you would to your log a
dated entry:

> *Finished 5k line Perl script to spider the web. Used LWP::Simple
> module...*

etc.

Maintain focus and balance. We assume that this information will be read
at some point in the future by someone who'll want to hire you. Don't
put irrelevant information like what you've eaten for breakfast
(maintain focus).

Also don't post trivia like *wrote 5 lines of Perl code to display
"Hello world"* (maintain balance).

It's a win-win situation. Potential employer has a much better chance to
assess your skills and experience. You'll have a better chance to
showcase your skills and you'll have an edge over resumes that only say
"Programming skills: C/C++, PHP". Of course you should start now, the
day you're out of work is probably a few years late. Blogs are a good
way to maintain this "extended resume". You might use categories (a
feature of many blogging systems, e.g.
[Radio](http://radio.userland.com/)) to integrate this into your
blogging flow.

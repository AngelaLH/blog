Slate [knows why Amiga failed](http://slate.msn.com/?id=2072037). It was
too innovative for its time, they say. This article is an example of how
easy it is too confuse correlation with causation.

Yes, Amiga was extremely advanced for its time but that was not the
reason it failed. Amiga was successful for a long time. It failed mostly
because it did not evolve as fast as PC did.

Amiga started with much better graphics and sound than PC but after a
few years PC got good graphics and sound. And then got better. Amiga
started without IDE (hard-drive) interface. When IDE started to becoming
a standard, low-cost part of a PC, Amiga still didn't have it. You had
to buy external interfaces that cost as much as the drive itself. The OS
didn't improve much either while at the same time hundreds of
programmers in Redmond were busily adding new features to Windows.

Commodore apparently thought that computer business is a sprint: create
great product, ship it, go to sleep and start collecting money. Repeat
after a few years. But computer business is a marathon, you cannot go to
sleep. The moment you ship version N of your product you should already
be working on version N+1.

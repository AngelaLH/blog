Even if you don't do research, it's worthwhile to read [Richard
Hamming's talk](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html).

The core of his thinking lies in the question he used to ask
his co-workers: "What is the most important research topic in your area?
Are you working on it? If not, why not?".

You could replace "most important research topic" with "most important thing to
do in your life" and the question will still stand.

In other words, think big and do big.

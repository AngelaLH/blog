I love internet. What else would enable me to watch
[Lightweight Languages Workshop 2002](http://ll2.ai.mit.edu) (LL2). I
liked the talk about Erlan (I don't care much about Erlang but the
presenter was entertaining), talk about disruptive programming language
technologies and a talk about new language called
[Needle](http://www.nongnu.org/needle/). Being there would be much more
fun but being able to watch it is second best option.

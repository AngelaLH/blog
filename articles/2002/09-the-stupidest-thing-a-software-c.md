Title: The stupidest thing a software company can do

My computing background is [Amiga](http://www.amiga.org/), a platform
that refuses to die. I was just watching .avi of some old Amiga demo and
nostalgia kicked in. And thoughts came to my mind, uninvited.

At the time I was submerged in and fascinated by Amiga I didn't know
much about anything (I still don't but it's more than it used to be).
Long after Amiga was de facto dead, I've read a lot about its eventful
history, including [this
interview](http://my.net-link.net/~lmcgahey/interview.html) with Jay
Miner. There is a lesson there. The lesson is that people (if they're
good) are every company's biggest assets. Amiga was designed by a few
talented people. Here's what Jay says about one member of the team:

(Intuition is the name for the windowing system in Amiga. Think Gnome
but with a usable file manager). So here we have one person doing the
work that usually takes a lot of people to do. And doing an excellent
job at it (I know, I learned GUI programing on Intuition, doing
everything in assembly because assembler was the only tool that would
run on this 512 kB machine; on a side note: I wish Palm OS programmers
would copy Amiga OS instead of Mac OS).

Commodore bought Amiga from the team who designed it (at the time very
desperate team) and that's how Commodore Amiga was born as a product. If
you put different pieces of information available on the net together
you'll figure out that after amazingly successful lunch Commodore
committed the stupidest mistake any software company can make: it didn't
work work hard to keep their brilliant team. All those people soon went
somewhere else instead of keep working of improving Amiga. I doubt they
did it because they were bored or lost interest. There must have been
something very wrong with the way Commodore treated those superstars
that they decided to abandon their beloved child and go work somewhere
else. And Commodore, happy milking their cash cow, kept nailing their
own coffin by being so slow to update the machines. A computer that
started with a few years head-start in graphics and sound capabilities
remained basically unchanged while the ugly, little-endian PC crawled
forward, slowly but at a steady pace, getting things that Amiga lacked
(at some point the price of an IDE hard-drive was effectively twice as
much as for PC because you had to had an add-on interface card that cost
as much as a hard-drive itself) and finally even matched Amiga's
graphics capabilities. And then surpassed it many times over. Classical
tale of a rabbit and a turtle.

Ok, make that two mistakes.

So remember, kids: source code is useless if you don't have skilled
people to work on it.

Software business is a marathon, not a sprint. Plan for it. Microsoft
isn't what it is because one particular version of their product was a
child of Brilliance and Inspiration. Microsoft is here because every
version is better than a previous version. Because they know that there
will be another version and they start planning it before they finish
current version. Same with Oracle. Same with SAP. Those are the
engagement rules of software business: hire the best and keep them
constantly cranking new code. For [ten
years](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html). Then
start looking for your name in the [Forbes'
list](http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/27/400.html).

[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says: over
time a category will divide and become two or more categories. E.g.
computers started as a single category but broke up into mainframes,
workstations, personal computers, laptops etc. Cars started as a single
category but divided into luxury cars, sport cars, RVs, minivans etc.
Companies often don't understand that and instead think that categories
are combining, believe in synergy. Leader can maintain dominance by
addressing emerging categories with new brand names instead of using
brand name successful in one category in a new category. E.g. when Honda
wanted to go up-market it created a new brand, Acura.

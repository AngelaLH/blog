[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says:
there's an irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand and
it's a mistake. Instead one should create new brands to address new
markets/products.

*My comment: in this chapter authors predict (in 1993) that Microsoft
will fail because they use this unhealthy strategy of extending their
brand to new products. 9 years later and Microsoft is still going
strong. Looks like the law doesn't hold universally.*

If you're writing code, there is a [video of a good
talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/effective-api-design) by Joshua
Bloch on designing good APIs. It has a Java slant, since Joshua is one
of designers of Java APIs, but the advice is generic enough to apply to
other languages.\

Beware the video: it's in flash but uses a bad player that cannot be
paused (well, it can, I just couldn't unpause it) so be prepared to sit
through all 70 minutes of it at once. To all video providers: please
also provide a version that I can download and watch in my favorite
player at my leisure.\

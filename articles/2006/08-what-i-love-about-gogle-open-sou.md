Title: What I love about Google open-source project hosting

--------------
I love how easy it is to create a new project, especially compared to
protracted sourceforge process. It's so easy that even though I have my
own server that already hosts several of my Subversion repositories,
I've already switched a couple of repositories to Google. It's just so
much simpler to click a few buttons on a web page that login to my
server, create a repository, update permissions file etc.\
\
And it's fast. Fast is good. Slow is bad. svn update being interrupted
in the middle due to server issue is bad. Sourceforge is bad.\
\
Now about things that I don't like.\
\
Their search has outright bugs. I have a project called "qemacs-kjk" but
I can't find it if I search for "qemacs-kjk". I can find it if I search
for "qemacs". If I was king of search, I would feel embarassed right
about now.\
\
It's hard to get to a list of your projects (i.e. your profile page).
There's no obvious link anywhere, you can't get there through "My
Account". So far the only way I found is to search for one of your
projects and use a link from project summary. That's why browsers will
have bookmarks in years to come.\
\
The list of projects in user profile page just begs to have the short
description of the project listed next to project name.\
\
Project hosting launched only recently and I'm sure that the team is
working hard on adding new features. Here are the features that I would
like to see.\
\
Much better repository browsing. Right now it's the most basic thing you
can imagine. Syntax coloring would be nice. Even nicer would be if they
ported GeSHI from PHP to Python, used it for syntax coloring on their
site and released the code.\
\
Personally I'm a big fan of timeline view (as implemented by e.g.
[CVSTrac](http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/timeline) and copied by
[Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/timeline)). I think that in open-source,
collaborative projects knowing what happened recently is the most
important information. A view like that would be really nice. Most
SVN/CVS web-based repository browsers don't have that, though.\
\
Speaking of CVSTrac/Trac, I think [Mr.
Hipp](http://www.hwaci.com/drh/index.html) had the right idea with issue
tracking/wiki/source control integration. Being able to automatically
link issues with checkins is good. Very, very good.\
\
Google already has issue tracking. An integrated system for providing
the face of the project (i.e. a wiki or something like that) would be
nice too.\
\
Personally, I think that for discussions the [jos-style
forum](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/forum_sumatra/) is the best for
projects that don't generate too much discussion (and that's a majority;
for those that do generate a lot of discussion regular mailing list
could be better).\
\
Even if Google Code developers shared my opinion, I've worked at too
many companies to believe that they wouldn't be pressured to push for
Google Groups integration. I just wish that Groups team would fix their
RSS feeds so that:\

-   they have full text in the body, so that I don't have to go back to
    a web page to read every message. Kinds of defeats the purpose of
    RSS if I have to do that.
-   they actually work in Bloglines. Currently they update as frequently
    and erratically as U.S. is starting a new war. They should update
    within 24 hr, to keep conversation fluid

Google's Code is a very promising alternative to Sourceforge. Yes, they
don't claim to compete with Sourceforge, but they do. And it's a good
thing because Sourceforge was never good and hasn't improved
significantly in years. Google Code is already better (at least for the
kinds of things I want to do) and could be really ass kicking service in
the future.\

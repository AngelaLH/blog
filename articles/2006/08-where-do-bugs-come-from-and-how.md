--------------
It's frustrating that we, programmers, write bugs in our code.\
\
One way to figure out how to avoid writing bugs (or, more realistically,
write less bugs) is to understand where do bugs come from.\
\
Recently I realized that there are only two sources of software bugs:\

-   ignorance
-   carelessness\

Probably not the greatest of insights, but I haven't seen it spelled out
this way before.\
\
Since it seemed like a topic bigger than a blog post, I've written up a
longer article about [where do bugs come from and how to avoid
them](/articles/sourceOfBugs.html).\

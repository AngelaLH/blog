I’ve made a small update to [15minutes](/software/15minutes/) for
windows to fix few small things that were never the less annoying in
frequent usage.

First, when the timer finishes, the window no longer steals focus from
whatever it is you’re doing.

Second, the window is smaller - important when running on lower
resolution screens.

And finally, when the timer is running, it gets slightly different
background color so that it’s easy to tell if timer is running or not (I
would sometimes forget to start the timer).

And here’s how it looks like:

[15minutes](/software/15minutes/) is a simple
productivity tool I wrote.

One of productivity techniques is [time
boxing](http://www.davecheong.com/2006/07/26/time-boxing-is-an-effective-getting-things-done-strategy/).
[Pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is a similar
idea.

Procrastination is avoiding work. To avoid procrastination you just have
to start working.

One reason we avoid work is because the tasks seem big and overwhelming.
Time boxing is a mental trick - instead of thinking about doing the
whole task, we focus about working on a task for a fixed, short period
of time.

To implement time boxing you need a timer which will alert you about the
end of time boxing period.

Any timer will do - a physical timer, iPhoneâ€™s built-in clock etc.

I wrote a small application to do it, since most of my work is done on a
computer. [15minutes](/software/15minutes/) is
that application.

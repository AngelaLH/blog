[This article](http://www.marketingprofs.com/3/dsouza24.asp) talks about
how to better sell via web-site. It's a bit long-winded but the message
is simple: provide as much information as possible e.g. if you sell
software, put your manuals, detailed descriptions, screenshots,
testimonials etc. on-line. The more the better.

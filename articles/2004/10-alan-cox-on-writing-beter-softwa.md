by Alan Cox, famous for his work on Linux kernel, is worth propagating
so I’m doing my part.

Cox doesn’t say anything new. It’s a good thing, because usually new
ideas turn out to be wildly incorrect. What he does is a very nice
summary of known techniques for writing better software i.e. software
with less bugs. You’ll get the same (and more) by reading
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619670/">Code
Complete</a> 2nd ed, but it’s a nice summary of a particular topic (Code
Complete covers much more, is much bigger and therefore more difficult
to digest) and it doesn’t hurt to read about this stuff one more time.

University of Washington provides some of their colloquia and courses as
on-line video:\

-   [colloquia](http://norfolk.cs.washington.edu/htbin-post/unrestricted/colloq/search.cgi)
    (make sure to change search criteria to see all previous talks)
-   [courses](http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/dl/course_index.html)
-   [main page](http://www.cs.washington.edu/news/colloq.info.html)

In the colloquia page you can access recent [talk by
Google](http://glinden.blogspot.com/2004/10/googles-kirkland-office.html)
where they (supposedly - I haven't seen it yet) announced Google tech
campus in Kirkland.

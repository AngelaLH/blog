When you look at TOS of Google, you'll find that one thing you
absolutely cannot do is to scrape results returned by Google.

They've build their whole business on scrapping, storing and
re-formatting web pages created by others. They're sultans of scrapping.
And they have the gall to tell you that scrapping them is illegal.

Google - king of hypocrits.

Google - we scrap a lot.

Google - don't scrap us, we'll scrap you.

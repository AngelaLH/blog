Review of [Hot Text - web writing that works][1].

Verdict: if you write for web, in any capacity, "Hot text" is worth reading.

At first "Hot text" threw me off with their hype-filled treatment of object-
orientation (as applied to writing, none the less) and XML, but when it got to
the meat of their advice on writing, I quickly forgot those initial awkward
moments.

The book is written for those who want to improve their writing for the web.
It offers both generic tips like:

  * writing should be short, simple and clear
  * break up long paragraphs into short ones
  * make text scannable
  * remove hype and marketoid speak
  * write in active voice
  * write with emotions
  * have a personal voice
  * link to other sites (gives you credibility)

as well as addresses specific kinds of web content:

  * home page
  * navigation menus
  * help section and FAQs
  * product information
  * privacy policy
  * e-mail responses to customers
  * web marketing copy
  * press release
  * news
  * webzines
  * e-mail newsletters
  * weblogs

While not as deep and inspiring like ["On writing well"][2], it's filled with
practical advice. and definitely worth reading for anyone who has to write for
the web (especially those that don't have prior experience in copy writing).

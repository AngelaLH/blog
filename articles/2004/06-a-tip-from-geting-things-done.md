[Getting things
done](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000280/) is a
book about improving your productivity i.e. how to do more in less time.

Being efficient is about executing on ideas we have. One problem is that
we have more ideas than we can execute on. The book can be summarized as
a system for cataloguing the ideas, prioritizing them and executing
them.

One of the tips from the book: an important thing is to commit ideas
from our head into some more permanent medium. If we don't they'll use
up our mental energy. Book's system is based on paper but other tools
can be used as well.

As for me, I'll experiment with using this weblog for recording my ideas
(for those ideas that can be made public) and [my personal
wiki](../../../2004/06/04/wikipedia-as-a-personal-wiki.html) for ideas
that I want to keep for myself. Let's see how it goes.

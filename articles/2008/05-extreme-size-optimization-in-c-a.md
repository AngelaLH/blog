Following the sage advice of releasing early and often, I'm releasing my
magnum opus [Extreme (size) optimization in C and
C++](http://extremeoptimizationinc.org/).

It's meant to be a book about techniques to make your C, C++ and even
Objective-C (it being a superset of C) code as small as possible and use
as little memory as possible. All based on real-life code.\
It's certainly early (only one chapter is complete) and hopefully I'll
be updating it often.

So give it a look and enjoy the extremism.

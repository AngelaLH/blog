It's probably just a matter of being used to certain ways, but being a recent
Windows->Mac switcher, the fact that Page Up and Page Down in a text editor
moves the text without moving the cursor was driving me nuts.

I'm not the only and [this article][1] describes how to fix it. And, as an
additional bonus, how to remap Home and End keys to move to beginning/end of a
line, instead of beginning/end of a file.

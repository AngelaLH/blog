--------------
A smaller update to my PDF viewer for Windows. The biggest improvement
is in handling more PDFs correctly (e.g. those generated with Crystal
Reports)

Other changes:

-   improved rendering of some PDFs
-   support for links inside PDF file
-   added -restrict and -title cmd-line options (contributed by Matthew
    Wilcoxson)
-   enabled SyncTex support which mistakenly disabled in 0.9
-   misc fixes and translation updates

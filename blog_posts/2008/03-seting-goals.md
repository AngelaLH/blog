For complex goals:

-   3 actions that will take you closer to your goals
-   1 action that will take you closer today
-   1 action that can be done daily
-   1 major obstacle and how it can be overcome
-   1 way to improve skills in that area

Students given periodic deadlines do better than students with no
deadlines.

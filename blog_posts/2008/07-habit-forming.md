Habits are formed over a period of time and often associated with
triggers e.g. eating chips on a couch forms a habit and we start eating
chips just because we sit on a couch.

To break a habit: remove the triggers. To continue a habit: surround
yourself with triggers.

Smokers are more likely to quit while on vacation, when surrounded by
unfamiliar people and things, because the familiar triggers vanish.

Students that transfer between colleges are more likely to continue
running (a habit) if training place in a new college is similar to one
in previous college.

(Ruby + UI framework): 25 MB\
Capabilities: pretty similar\

 Ok, so Ruby probably does a little bit more, so it's a bit apples to
oranges comparison, but it's one huge orange and one tiny apple.\
\
 Was there ever a better example of a gigantic difference that a
thoughtful design can produce.\
\
 One data point: libcairo (which is a 2D graphic rendering library and
is part of Shoes) comes in at 536 kB which is nearly the size of the
whole Rebol system (which is a full blown language interpreter AND a 2D
graphic rendering library with capabilities similar to libcairo AND a
full blown UI framework with buttons, scrollbars and what not).\

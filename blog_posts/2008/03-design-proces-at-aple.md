Design process at Apple (from
http://www.businessweek.com/the\_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples\_design\_p.html):

-   pixel-perfect prototypes
-   build 10 different mockups for every feature, then 3 out of those
    ten for more work, then settle on 1

Itâ€™s better to try out many ideas than overthink less ideas. winners do
more experiments faster

For faster metabolism:

-   vitamin B (spinach, asparagus, beans (navy, soy, black beans),
    melon, broccoli, fish, poultry, eggs
-   magnesium (green vegetables like spinach), halibut, nuts (almonds,
    cashews, peanuts), soybeans, whole-grain cereals, oatmeal,
    black-eyed peas and lentils.
-   snack with healthy carbs and proteins (peanut butter and banana,
    trail mix, hummus and baby carrots, apple with low-fat cheddar
    cheese). protein + carb regulates blood sugar, energy levels and
    feelings of satiety
-   eat breakfast (increases resting metabolism by 10%). whole-grain
    cereal and fruit, whole-wheat toast and peanut butter or fat-free
    yogurt with granola
-   interval training - short bouts of intense activity with lower
    intensity activity (e.g. alternate sprint and jog)
-   strength training

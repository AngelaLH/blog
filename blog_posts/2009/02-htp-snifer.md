A simplified http sniffer for windows.

Like HTTP Sniffer, except better designed.

Design improvements:

-   automatically saves captures (no need to do it manually)
-   easy selection of interfaces to sniff
-   start/stop (resume)
-   shows sizes, measures latency and speed of requests
-   adds automatic [redbot-like](http://redbot.org/) analysis of HTTP
    requests

Similar things:

-   [HTTP Scoop](http://www.tuffcode.com/) for mac. \$15
-   [HTTP Sniffer](http://www.http-sniffer.com/), \$30 (non-commercial),
    \$50 (commercial)

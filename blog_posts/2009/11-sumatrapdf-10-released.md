I’ve released 1.0 version of Sumatra. Compared to 0.9.4 it has bunch of
bug fixes and small improvements. Each of them is too small to single
out, but together they improve Sumatra quite a bit.

This version gets the 1.0 version and officially is out of beta because,
well, it’s time.

This version has received great many improvements from Simon Bünzli
(zeniko) and some more TeXSync support fixes from William Blum so they
deserve much credit for this release.

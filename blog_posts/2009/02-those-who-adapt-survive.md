Those who adapt are better than those who don’t.

An observation: Microsoft is the second company, after Amazon, to go
after hosted data-base market. Not Oracle. Not MySQL. Not any other
relational database company (or relational database open-source project
like PostgreSQL).

Microsoft knows how to adapt to changing environment, those other
companies don’t and that’s one of the reasons while Microsoft remains
extremely profitable and relevant while many other tech companies come
and go.

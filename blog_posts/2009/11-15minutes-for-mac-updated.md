--------------
I’ve made two small improvement to my [15minutes](/software/15minutes/)
app for mac (which is meant as a simple productivity tool that helps to
focus on doing things).

Improvements:

-   time display is bigger
-   it now has non-awful icon

I also came to a realization that it should really be more unobtrusive
app that lives in the menu bar and has even more minimal UI. However, at
present I don’t have the time to do that. 15minutes has been something
that I wanted to get done as quickly as possible. It would be ironic if
my productivity dropped due to spending a lot of time working on
productivity-enhancing application.

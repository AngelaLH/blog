Even the smallest of web applications face the same design issues that were
solved thousand of times: designing a login and registration screens,
navigation scheme, searching, shopping cart etc. A person facing such problem
has two options:

  * re-invent the wheel, most likely coming up with a wheel that is inferior
to some of the existing wheels
  * research prior art and implement the best existing solution

[Patterns in Interaction Design][1] website is immensely helpful if one chooses
the "research prior art" option. It's a very good, categorized collection of
solutions to such common problems (patterns) for web and gui design (web
section is much bigger than gui section). The value of the site:

  * gathers all this information in one place
  * provides good categorization of patterns
  * each pattern is described in concise and regular manner; pattern
description states the problem a given pattern solves as well as the solution


This website is an invaluable resource to any web designer and web developer.
If it was used more often we would have less broken web interfaces.

Also recommended similar sites:

  * [UI patterns][2] - a decent selection of GUI patterns
  * [User Interface Design Patterns][3] - also GUI patterns

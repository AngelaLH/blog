Looks like someone is reading this blog after all. Yesterday I wrote
about new collaborative text editor for Windows called
[multi-editoro](http://me.sphere.pl/) and a reader pointed me to
[DocSynch](http://docsynch.sourceforge.net).

DocSynch is an interesting approach to building collaborative editor: it
only implements a protocol layer based on IRC and plugs into existing
editors. Currently they have a plugin for [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/)
and are planning additional plugins for Eclipse, vim and Visual Studio.

Another day, another text editor to check out.

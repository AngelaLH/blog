--------------
I've released [wTail](/software/wtail/). wTail does on Windows what tail
does on Unix. You can monitor changes to a text file. Ideal for watching
log files or Apache error logs during development. Requires .NET
Framework 1.1.

The only interesting thing about the app is how easy it was to write. I
don't know .NET very well yet I was able to piece a useful application.
It's only about 600 lines of code but can do what it can thanks to all
the classes in .NET framework and excellent [scintailla editor
control](http://www.scintilla.org/) (and its [.NET
wrapper](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scide/)).

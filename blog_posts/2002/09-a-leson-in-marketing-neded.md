**A lesson in marketing needed.** It looks like many companies need
merketing lesson. Here's aÂ ["marketing"
description](http://www.xengames.com/productsif.htm) of a game:

> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 9px">\

> -   <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">Particle engine.</span>

> -   <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">Shadow effect.</span>

Do they really think that people care about their 3D engine. Do they
think that people even know what a mipmapping or particle engine is?
This thing has clearly been written by a programmer who's so proud about
his technical achievements that he fails to see that people don't care
about them. Bad marketing.

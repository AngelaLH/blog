It comes from the "I couldn't say it better myself" department: this [excellent
post](http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=15621&ixReplies=8)
presents 12 reasons why a good programmer should not worry about
employment.

I remember discussion with other programmers where they
claimed that because VB and other such tools make programming easier,
there will be less work and less demand for programmers.

To which I say: bull.

Those tools make *some* programming easier but at the same time a
lot of programming becomes harder because our software gets bigger.

We need to keep existing software up-to-date and every year we come up with
completely new categories of software to write: web servers, IM systems,
weblog software, native XML databases, web search engines.

There'll be plenty of work for competent programmers.

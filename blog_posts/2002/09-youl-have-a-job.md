This [excellent
post](http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&ixPost=15621&ixReplies=8)
presents 12 reasons why a good programmer should not worry about
employment. It comes from the "I couldn't say it better myself"
department. I remember discussion with other programmers where they
claimed that because VB and other such tools make programming easier,
there will be less work and less demand for programmers. [To which I
say](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=%22to+which+I+say%22):
bull. Those tools make *some* programming easier but at the same time a
lot of programming becomes harder (because our software gets bigger),
there are tons of new software that begs to be written and every year we
tend to come up with a new, uncharted territory waiting to be filled
with new software (web servers anyone?, IM systems, weblog software,
native XML databases, web search engines - the list goes on and on).
There'll be plenty of work for good people.

[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says: in
the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race. McDonald and Burger
King. Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Nike and Reebok. Crest and Colgate.

My comment: even if that was universally true, how does it help a
marketing person? There's little a marketing person can do about the
position of his company in the market. The only conclusion I can make is
that if I were a marketing person and worked for No. 3 company, I should
just quit and apply for a job in No. 2 or 1.

The other problem is that it isn't universally true and the book again
makes a big simplification of reality and it tries to support this
simplified picture with selectively chosen examples. There are market
where 2 brands can't fulfill all the demand (there are more than 2
well-known car manufacturers). There are markets that tend to fall into
monopoly (e.g. Microsoft has 95% of operating system and office software
markets). I'm sure there are many markets that are two-horse race, but
then again there are also three-horse race markets as well as highly
fragmented markets. This "law" is nothing but a sometimes true
observation and it's not true frequently enough to be worth anything.

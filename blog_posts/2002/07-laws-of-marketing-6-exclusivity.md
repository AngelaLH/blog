Title: Laws of marketing #6 (exclusivity)

[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667)says: it's
fruitless to try to take over a word that is already owned by a
competitor. Burger King tried to own word "fast" which was already owned
by McDonald; and failed miserably. FedEx tried to take over "worldwide"
from DHL.

*My comment: this talk about "owning" words is a bit silly. The book
doesn't say anything about how to actually own the word. I guess you're
supposed to use it in your marketing/advertisement material but such
statement is not very helpful for a marketer (I think; I'm not one).*

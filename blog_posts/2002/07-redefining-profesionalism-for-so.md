Philip Greenspun is unique among those who write about programming in
that he doesn't confine himself to writing about the nitty-gritty
details of technologies but occasionally writes about subjects that go
beyond that.

In [Redefining Professionalism for Software
Engineers](http://web.archive.org/web/20010604035443/www.arsdigita.com/asj/professionalism)
he wrote about the professionalism as applied to Software Engineers.

The history of this article is interesting - it first appeared in
ArsDigita Systems Journal, an ambitious (but failed) project at
Greenspun's ambitious (and also failed) company. At some point it must
have been considered too controversial since it has been unlinked from
ASJ's index.

Today ArsDigita and the whole ASJ is gone but we can still enjoy it
thanks to the wonderful [web archive](http://web.archive.org/).

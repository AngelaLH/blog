[A fine interview](http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-943064.html) with
Marcelo, Linux 2.4 kernel maintainer. He says many wise things. One
thing ringed less true than others, though:

> *We need to get ordinary people used to using Linux. It isn't that
> it's so hard to use, it's just different.*

Too bad it isn’t true. Linux is hard to use not only because it’s
different but because, well, it is difficult. I keep seeing the command
line attitude (“*using command line isn’t that hard”* or *“all you need
to do is ./configure & make & make install, what’s so hard about
that?”*). That’s so out of touch with reality that reading Cooper’s
[”Inmates are running the
asylum”](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672316498/) should be a
required reading for people who hold such beliefs. I’m not trying to
bash Marcelo here, he’s an extremely able person, but, as Cooper points
out, able people are easy to dismiss the difficulties that less able
people may have. This tendency is natural but can be fought with enough
introspection. And it should be fought because if people want bigger
adoption of Linux they have to understand why Linux isn’t being adopted
and one of the reasons is that it’s hard to use. Thinking otherwise is
just self-denial and an obvious consequence is that if you don’t think
something is a problem, you will never fix the problem.

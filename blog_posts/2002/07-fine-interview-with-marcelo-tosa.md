[A fine interview](http://www.zdnet.com/article/marcelo-tosatti-the-future-is-linux/) with
Marcelo, Linux 2.4 kernel maintainer. He says many wise things. One
thing ringed less true than others, though:

> *We need to get ordinary people used to using Linux. It isn't that
> it's so hard to use, it's just different.*

Too bad it isn’t true. Linux is hard to use not only because it’s
different but because, well, it is difficult. I keep seeing the command
line attitude (“*using command line isn’t that hard”* or *“all you need
to do is ./configure & make & make install, what’s so hard about
that?”*).

This is so out of touch with reality that reading Cooper’s
[”Inmates are running the
asylum”](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672316498/) should be a
required reading for people who hold such beliefs.

I’m not trying to bash Marcelo here, he’s an extremely able person, but,
as Cooper points out, able people are easy to dismiss the difficulties
that less able people may have.

People who want to see increased adoption of Linux should first figure out
why it's not being adopted despite a big price advantage.

First step in fixing any problem is admitting that you have a problem and
Linux does have usability problem.

[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says:
marketing effects take place over an extended period of time. It's a
mistake to sacrifice long-term planning with actions to improve
short-term balance sheet. E.g. sales increase short-term profits but in
long-term educates people to not buy for regular price, therefore
decreasing long-term profits.

Havoc [makes a great point](http://www106.pair.com/rhp/features.html)
about the realities of software development. Although his article is
aimed at people who want to get features into software, I think it
should first be read by people who manage software projects (Havoc
assumes that they already know but this is probably not the case). The
main insight is that software cannot grow infinitely. Each additional
feature has a cost of implementing it and of future maintenance.
Maintenance cost is non-linear: difficulty of maintaining the code grows
much faster than number of lines added. Such is the nature of software.

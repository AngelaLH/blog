[Here's](http://philip.greenspun.com/internet-application-workbook/writeup)
an interesting pro-blogging argument:

> *Also keep in mind that for every person reading this chapter a poor
> villager in India is learning SQL and Java. A big salary can evaporate
> quickly. Hundreds of thousands of American aerospace engineers laid
> off in the 1970s discovered this. The ones who'd toiled in obscurity
> on "landing gear bolt \#39" ended up as cab drivers or greeters at
> Walmart. A personal professional reputation, by contrast, is a bit
> harder to build than the big salary but also harder to lose. If you
> don't invest some time in writing (prose, not code), however, you'll
> never have any reputation outside your immediate circle of colleagues,
> who themselves may end up working at McDonald's and be unable to help
> you get an engineering job during a recession.*

A little more boring but similar in conclusion paper [How to be a leader
in your field](http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/leader.html).
Blogs are great tools that make it easy to write about your thoughts and
ideas on the web. But never forget: in the end, it's the quality of your
ideas that will make or break your reputation.

Title: The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed

Some ideas are so obviously good that you might be sure they'll take
over. One such idea was selling bits on the Internet.

There was a time where people were selling software via catalogs, had to
ship physical goods (diskettes; when was the last time you used a
diskette?) and accepting payments was a pain.

Then came the internet and a few started offering downloads instead of
diskettes and accepting payments on-line. The future was there, the
writing was on the wall. This way of doing business was so much better
that you could reasonably expect that everyone will switch to it. And so
they did.

I think that today we have another thing brewing up in the domain of
software marketing: animated demos.

The first animated demo for a software product I saw was [a demo for
CityDesk](http://www.paxlogica.com/cdFull.html). It's done in Flash (a
good use for Flash, would you expect that?).

Another one is [a demo for
ClickTracks](http://www.clicktracks.com/viewlets/60_second_demo_audio_viewlet_swf.html).

The idea just clicked with me. This is a powerful method of showing your
software to potential customers. People are very reluctant to part with
their money. The idea behind marketing is that you can convince them to
buy your product using finely crafted ads.Now you can show people how
good your software is.

It's not a replacement for advertisement, it's not a replacement for
manuals but it's a great complement of those. It can give you an edge
over competition.

If I was selling software I would start making those demos and putting
them on my web page. Now.

Parenthetical remark: truth to be told this is not a new idea. I
remember in very old days Lotus Cam (I think that was the name) allowed
people to capture a particular session with software andÂ create a
stand-alone demo that would replay that session. I never seen them used
much.

Today we've reached a breaking point for two reasons:

-   better tools to create demos; I'm pretty sure I could create such a
    demo myself if I tried really hard
-   better ways of showing demos to people. If it's Flash most people
    are already able to see it. If it isn't, installing a plugin is not
    that hard those days

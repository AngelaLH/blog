[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says: if
you're shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the
leader. Leverage the leader's strength into a weakness. Don't try to be
better than the leader, try to be different. E.g. Pepsi marketed itself
as a "choice for the new generation" when faced with Coca-cola's "old
and established" brand.

*My comment: sounds correct although doesn't apply to those who do have
ambitions to overtake the leader in exactly the same category (which
happens e.g. Excel took over Lotus 1-2-3 by being a better spreadsheet,
not a different spreadsheet).*

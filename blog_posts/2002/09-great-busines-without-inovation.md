Title: Great business without innovation

You don't need an ounce of innovation in order to have a very successful
business. At least according to [David
Wheeler](http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/microsoft.html).

I guess David's intention was just to show Microsoft in bad light but if you put
2 and 2 together, the inevitable conclusion is that you don't need any
innovative ideas in order to have good business.

It's just one of many examples that "innovation" per se is not equal to "good"
or "profitable". Ideas are worthless, execution is what matters.

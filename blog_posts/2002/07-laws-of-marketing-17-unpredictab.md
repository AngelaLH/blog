[The book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667) says:
unless you write your competitors' plans, you can't predict the future.
You don't know the future, you don't know what your competition will do
so you have to build your company and marketing strategies to be
flexible, to be able to quickly respond to changing situation.

--------------
[The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher "The Silver Searcher") is a command line utility for searching text files. Like grep, but faster. It's written in super-optimized C and gets a big speed boost by intelligently skipping files that you don't want to search (temporary binary files created by the compiler etc.).

It didn't have a Windows version, so [I've made one](/software/the-silver-searcher-for-windows.html).

It's the first release so there might be rough edges. If you find them, [let me know](/contactme.html) so that I can fix them.

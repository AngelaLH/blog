--------------
I released version 0.2 of [Sumatra
PDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/). Things that are
new:\

-   added facing, continuous and continuous facing viewing modes\
-   remember history of opened files\
-   session saving i.e. on exit remember which files are opened and\
    restore the session when the program is started without any\
    command-line parameters\
-   ability to open encrypted files\
-   "Go to page dialog"\
-   less invasive (less yellow) icon that doesn't jump at you on
    desktop\
-   fixed problem where sometimes text wouldn't show (better mapping\
    for fonts; use a default font if can't find the font specified in
    PDF\
    file)\
-   handle URI links inside PDF documents\
-   show "About" screen\
-   provide a download in a .zip file for those who can't run
    installation program\
-   switched to poppler code instead of xpdf

--------------
"Producing Open Source Software" by Karl Fogel looks like a book I need to
read. It's [available for free on-line][1].

I just finished listening to mp3 recordings of [a few talks][2] from Paul
Graham's Startup School. So far I've listened to talks by Paul Graham, Olin
Shivers and Steve Wozniak. Recommended.

Title: Backpack observations

--------------
I played with Backpack and my observations so far are:\

-   37signals are marketing masters - according to them 10 thousand
    people signed up for what is essentially an improved wiki. You've
    got to admire their hype-generation moves.\
-   Basecamp is a nicely designed variation on the wiki. They dumped
    revision history, de-emphasized wiki links (thank god), added
    notes/lists/images to each page.\
-   I like various dhtml tricks they do\
-   I don't like that they limit the width of the visible page,
    resulting in plenty of white-space on my browser\
-   the preview wiki rendering has a wierd bug: sometimes empty line
    didn't separate paragraphs in the preview. The problem was gone when
    I went to some other page and navigated back. But I only figured out
    that this is a temporary problem after spending 10 minutes trying to
    format the page the way it was supposed to be formatted\
-   their page count limits are terribly low (seriously, \$20/month for
    500 wiki pages? I can have shared hosting account for that much)
    and, bizarelly, they don't have an option for unlimited number of
    pages.\
-   their "we delete your stuff when you cancel your account" is a bit
    harsh and doesn't inspire warm and fuzzy feeling. Yes, I know you
    can (and should) export your data to XML before you cancel, but...
    What if you don't notice this option? What if you're one of those
    billions people on the planet that don't know what XML is and what
    can you do with it.\

So I'm in the foolish minority of people whose life was not [changed by
Backpack](http://backpackit.com/weblog/archives/buzzpress/backpack_has_changed_the_way_i_live.php).

It's good but clearly over-hyped . Real men need more than a variation
on a wiki to wet themselves from excitement and I remain dry.

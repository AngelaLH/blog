Gus Mueller, an author of a few simple Mac apps ([VoodooPad][1] and
[FlySketch][2]) wrote an article on [How to become an independent programmer
in just 1068 days.][3] Interesting if you're into those kinds of stories.

They confuse me, though. The stories, I mean. His lesson #1 is "Think small
and make sure you really like what you are doing". I can bet that I've read
someone else's lessons that claim exactly the opposite: that you should aim
high.

In the meantime, [writely.com][4] becomes worse and worse, instead of better
and better. When writing this post I got into state where every new text was a
hyperlink and I just couldn't tell writely otherwise. It acquired definitely
weird and obvious strange behaviours. Few days ago I tried to blockquote some
text in a document created in the past but writely kept ignored me. Looks like
they should spend more time QA'ing the editor as all those changes are
regressions from previously fine behaviour.

Jensent Harris [gives us an UI design tip][1]: icons are not enough.
Applications should label all the icons with text.

This tip is more than just a random opinion: it comes from Microsoft's
Office Group studies that taught them that people were not clicking on
icons in Office UI until they also labeled them.

This is one example of what Microsoft does well. I'm sure that they're
not alone in gathering detailed statistics about the usage of their
software so that they can make inform decisions about ways to improve
the software in the future but I would think it's very rare in software
industry. I've never heard about another software project gathering
such detailed statistics. If Open Office wants to battle Microsoft,
they should copy good processes that lead to designing and writing good
software and not just the end result of those processes.

Title: Rich client is here

I was always of the opinion that web-based access is great but in many
cases a rich client that uses the full power of your local resources is
even better.

[Stanford on iTunes][1] is an example of that. They could just offer their talks available as
downloads but offering them as an iTunes store is even better since you
can stream or download and play from within one program (especially
useful if you're a heavy iTunes user).

Not that iTunes doesn't have it problems. It doesn't seem to do any
caching or pre-fetching so that navigating the store is slower than I
would have liked, especially given that all they download in Stanford
case is a smallish list. This should be instantaneous (they should
remember the last state of a given page and update the list in the
background).

BTW: they do have some interesting talks. It one-ups [MIT OpenCourseWare][2]
by going audio. Who's gonna be the first to offer video recordings and notes
for all lectures they do?

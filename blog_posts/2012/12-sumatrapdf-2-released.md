--------------
[We](https://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/browse/trunk/AUTHORS)
are happy to announce release 2.2 of
[SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf), a
multi-format PDF, XPS, ebook (ePub, MOBI), DjVu reader for Windows.

In version 2.2 we’ve added support for
[FictionBook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FictionBook) ebook format.

We’ve added support for PDF documents encrypted with Acrobat X.

In a rare case where printing looks different than display, you can now
use “Print as image” compatibility option in print dialog.

For better viewing of manga comic books we now have a new command-line
option: -manga-mode [1|true|0|false].

Finally, we’ve made many robustness fixes and improvements. Too small to
describe them in detail but in aggregate they make a difference.

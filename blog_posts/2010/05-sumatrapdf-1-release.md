Changes since 1.0.1 release:

-   added book view (“View/Book View” menu item) option. It’s known as
    “Show Cover Page During Two-Up” in Adobe Reader
-   added “File/Properties” menu item, showing basic information about
    PDF file
-   added “File/Send by email” menu
-   added export as text. When doing “File/Save As”, change “Save As
    types” from “PDF documents” to “Text documents”. Don’t expect
    miracles, though. Conversion to text is not very good in most cases.
-   auto-detect commonly used TeX editors for inverse-search command
-   bug fixes to PDF handling (more PDFs are shown correctly)
-   misc bug fixes and small improvements in UI
-   add Ctrl + and Ctrl - as shortcuts for zooming (matches Adobe
    Reader)

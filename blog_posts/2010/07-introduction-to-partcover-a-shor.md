PartCover - a code coverage tool
--------------------------------

**Update:** you should now use
[OpenCover](https://github.com/sawilde/opencover), which is a newer
code-coverage tool by the author of PartCover.

PartCover is a code coverage tool for .NET. There’s a [SourceForge
project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/partcover/) that is a bit
dormant but does have an installer for the latest version and a [github
fork](http://github.com/sawilde/partcover.net4) with more recent code
development.

Unfortunately it’s not documented well (misleadingly, even) so here’s a
short tutorial.

Installation
------------

You can download the installer from [SourceForge
project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/partcover/) and install the
usual way. This post is based on build 4.0.10705 (latest at this time).

After you install, you can just copy DLLs and EXEs to any location and
run it from there. I keep the binaries in the source repository so that
I can run code coverage tests from my test scripts without the need to
have PartCover installed.

A note about 64-bit Windows
---------------------------

The 4.0 version can’t handle 64-bit mode. While .NET applications
consist of platform-independent bytecode, when the bytecode is executed,
it can be JIT-ed in 32-bit mode (the only option on 32-bit Windows and
possibility in 64-bit Windows) or 64-bit mode. For that reason, both
PartCover and the application being tested need to be forced into 32-bit
mode.

For PartCover, run
`[most recent Windows SDK]\bin\CorFlags.exe PartCover.exe /32BIT+ /Force`

For your application, you need to compile it in 32-bit mode. When using
csc compiler, use `/platform:x86`. In Visual Studio IDE, set Platform
Target in Build tab of project properties to x86 (default is `Any CPU`).

In my project, I have a special target for code coverage that compiles
with `/platform:x86` flag.

Running PartCover
-----------------

The basic flow is:

-   run your executable under PartCover.exe
-   inspect the results (generated by PartCover.exe as an XML file)

Basic option for PartCover:

-   `--target <taget>` : name of the the .NET executable to test
-   `--output <output-file>` : name of the XML file with results
-   `--include <[Assembly]class>` : which assemblies/classes to include
    in code coverage. Can be used multiple times
-   `--exclude <[Assembly]class>` : which assemblies/classes to exclude
    from code coverage. By default [mscorlib]\* and [System\*]\* are
    excluded. Can be used multiple times

An example invocation:

`PartCover --target bin\UnitTests.exe --include [NachoDB]* --include [UnitTests]* --output partcover.xml`

What it means:

-   we run code coverage on `bin\UnitTests.exe` .NET executable and all
    the assemblies it uses
-   the executable uses NachoDB.dll assembly, so ask for code coverage
    (`--include`) of all classes in NachoDB and UnitTests assemblies. As
    you can see, you can use ‘\*’ as a simple regular expression matcher
    with the expected meaning
-   the results of code coverage are saved in `partcover.xml` file

Looking at the results
----------------------

PartCover includes PartCover.Browser application that can be used to
configure and run code coverage tests and browse the results.

To browse existing results use `File/Open Report...` menu and open
`partcover.xml` file. Also, use `Views/View Coverage Details` menu -
results are not useful without it.

On the left you’ll see a list of assemblies with their classes and
methods. When you click on a method, on the right you’ll see source code
of that method annotated with code coverage information (lines with
green background have been executed):

Alternatively, you can adapt for your purposes [my python
script](/article/Converting-PartCover-results-to-html.html) that
generates set of html files with the results of code coverage.

Alternatives
------------

There are alternatives, but not great ones.

### Visual Studio

Expensive edition of Visual Studio has a code coverage built in.
However, it’s a total disaster in usability and I was unable to get it
to work.

What I expected is that it works like code profiling: I choose the
binary, arguments and environment variables, run it, the results show
up.

Visual Studio has other ideas. It seems that if I want to do code
coverage from UI, I have to create a project specifically for that. It’s
insane and I didn’t even try.

There is a way to do it from command line, by instrumenting the binaries
with a cmd-line tool and running it with code coverage service process
running (a byzantine and over-complicated setup, if you ask me). I tried
this method following posts scattered on the internet but I ended up
with empty code coverage results and no error message to tell me what’s
wrong. Thank you, Microsoft, for wasting my time.

### NCover

NCover used to be free and open-source tool but is now commercial. The
few screenshots they have on their website look good but they won’t give
you a trial version unless you give them your e-mail address and I wont.

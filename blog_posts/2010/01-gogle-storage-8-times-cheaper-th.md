7.92 times cheaper, to be exact, if my calculations are right. According
to [this page](https://www.google.com/accounts/purchasestorage), you can
buy 1TB of storage for \$256/year. According to [this
calculator](http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html), 1TB (1024
GB) of S3 storage costs \$169 per month. A simple math tells us that
\$169 \* 12 / 256 is about 8 and that’s how much cheaper Google’s
storage is compared to S3.

I know it’s not exactly the same service, but the difference in cost is
simply astonishing.

Is Amazon overcharging? Is Google 8 times more efficient than Amazon? Or
is Google willing to loose its shirt in short term but set up a stage
for the world of cheap, interchangeable, Chrome OS-running laptops
without local storage, whose users mostly use Google’s on-line apps.

I don’t really care why - at \$256/year for a terabyte of cloud storage
it starts to look like an interesting alternative to drobo.

Before you register a
[DBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doing_business_as) name (i.e. Doing
Business As, also known as Fictitious Business Name), you need to make
sure that a given name is available. For a San Francisco business, you
can do an on-line search of existing names
[here](http://www.criis.com/sanfrancisco/sfictitious.shtml). If the name
you chose is not on that list, you’re good to go.

As a side-note: registering DBA in California requires posting a notice
in the newspaper. First, it’s oddly antiquated in a state that is home
to Silicon Valley. Second, what will happen after the inevitable
downfall of paper editions of newspapers?

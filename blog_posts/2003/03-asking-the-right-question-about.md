[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com) is an unusual [keynote
speaker](http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg02667.html)
for a Python conference. What I like is that he asks the question about
a language design that I've never seen being asked by others: how should
a language for the next 100 years look like. There's a lot of different
languages and even those most popular either happened as a research
project or just happened. Graham designs [his own
language](http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html) and he just might have a
chance at doing it right.

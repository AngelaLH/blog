Title: Good software, bad buying experience

Now that I told you that Frigate is the best file manager I know, I'll
tell you that [Frigate](http://www.frigate3.com/) - the company sucks.

My 30-day trial period just ended so I went on-line and bought "Frigate
Professional" (\$59.90 but if you know the right URL you can get it for
\$39.94) via RegSoft. That was 3 days ago and I still don't have the
registration info and as a result can't use the software.

When I ordered I received a confirmation e-mail with a link to a web
page with my order status. That's all good except that the status still
is "unprocessed". I don't know if it's RegSoft that sucks or is it
Frigate so uninterested in my money but I'm pissed, I don't care and
I'll never buy from them again (and would cancel my order if I could).

The thing is: the Internet creates an expectation of instant
gratification. I pay and I expect to have the goods within minutes given
that what I'm buying is a link where I can download a few megabytes of
code or an unlock code for the software that I already have. I expect
that because it's possible and everyone else gives me that.

The guys selling Frigate violated this expectation. The result: no more
money from me and this post where I tell everyone that they suck.

Lessons:

-   when you sell software, provide instant gratification
-   when you sell software, avoiding pissingÂ  people off is even more
    important than delighting them (you should do both, of course)

**How much can you make writing computer books.** Articles [like this
one](http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/146.aspx) are the reason I
love Internet. Where else could I find out how much one can
realistically expect to earn by writing a computer book? Written by a
definitive source (i.e. someone who was there, did that)? Read the
article for the details but in summary: not much, say \$14 k for seven
months of work (which ends up being \$2 k/month). For a more amusing
take on computer books publishing industry, read [Philip
Greenspun's](http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/dead-trees/story.html)
experience.\

\
Which brings to me to a question: is there a better way? The assumption
is that you want to write on technical subject and earn a little money
(a little is key here as we just established that you can't expect to
earn much through writing books). As it happens, Google's AdSense
program has just been launched and becomes [quite
popular](http://daringfireball.net/2003/07/independent_days.html). Some
even report respectable earnings (although it's too early to tell
whether it's because it's a viable revenue source or is it because of
novelty that'll quickly wear off).\

\
So here's the plan:\

-   write a book on a popular subject\
-   publish it on the web\
-   add AdSense ads\
-   profit!\

\
This is, of course, a pure speculation on my part - I have no idea if
page views that a book on technical subject can bring is enough to earn
\$14 k in ad revenue as I never did that. But there are other benefits
in going web self-publishing way\

-   publishing on the web is of greater benefit to human-kind\
-   you can keep your book up-to-date (actually I think you would have
    to both in order to keep up with changing technology and to bring
    more hits)\
-   you can capture readers contributions the way Philip Greenspun
    describes in his [1997 classic that is sort of embarrassing
    now](http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/) i.e. you can make other
    people's thoughts to make your site more valuable\
-   publishing on the web gives interesting (yet rarely embraced)
    possibilities of improving the text (e.g. full text search, good
    index, animations to illustrate concepts)\
-   it isn't unheard of to get the publishing deal anyway\

\
But won't the bandwidth cost kill you? It shouldn't, if you smart. I'm
too lazy to calculate (even in the back-of-the-envelope style) how much
bandwidth would it take to deliver enough hits for advertising to pay
off, but you can get 700 GB (that's a lot) for \$100 per month at
[RackShack.net](http://www.rackshack.net/english/all.asp).\

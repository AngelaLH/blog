Consider this quote from [As we may
think](http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm):

> *A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
> records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be
> consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.*

Is it just me or does that sound like something
RIAA/MPAA/EvilBookPublisher wouldn't like you to do (to the point of
suing you if you did)? Does that sound like excessive copyrights stand
in the way of progress?

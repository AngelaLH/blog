**Popular fallacies.** There are times when people try to bullshit their
way during an argument. In that case it's good to know the most popular
bullshits, otherwise known as logical fallacies. There is a list
[here](http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/index.htm) and
[here](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/), both with good
explanations why a given fallacy is indeed a fallacy and not a
legitimate argument.

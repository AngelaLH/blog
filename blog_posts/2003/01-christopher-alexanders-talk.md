Mitch Kapor's
[talk](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/030129.html) is not
yet available. While you wait, you can just as well watch Christopher
Alexander's [talk](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/ay0001.html). His
was the guy whose usage of the word "patterns" was so widely adopted in
the software world. And check out [his
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195019199/) (it
took me few months to read it but it was worth it).

Just a reminder that you should be careful when reading stuff (on the
Internet and otherwise). As an example read this:

> *Building a platform doesn't pay. No single company made a fortune
> building the Internet. IBM didn't take the lions share of the design
> of the PC.*

(taken from a comment deep-down in [this
article](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2003/ebooks_0903.html)
about e-books, P2P and stuff).

Sometimes it's what they don't say that invalidates their conclusion. A
thesis and 2 examples to support the thesis. Is the thesis valid? Not
really. Look at Microsoft - an example of extreme wealth acquired, in
great part, by **succesfully** building a platform. Or even Apple
(struggling but still alive thanks to the platform they built) or
Playstation or Nintendo. Building a platform pays extremely well. You
just have to do it right.

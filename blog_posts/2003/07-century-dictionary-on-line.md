[This](http://www.global-language.com/century/) is an interesting
project: putting a public domain (copyright expired) dictionary on-line.
Too bad it's an exercise in showing the capabilities of a looser image
compression technology DjVu (looser because it's too little too late)
and not an exercise in making really good on-line dictionary.

And a copyright side-note. The site has the following copyright
statement: *"CGI software, user interface, and images are Â© copyright
2001 Global Language Resources, Inc."*. My question is: how can they
copyright "images" given that they're merely a scanned version of a book
in public domain?
